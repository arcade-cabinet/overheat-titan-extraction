## §1 — What is built (detail)

### Scaffold
- `package.json` — all dependencies locked (see `docs/STANDARDS.md §11`)
- `vite.config.js` — `@vitejs/plugin-react`, optimizeDeps for Three.js ecosystem
- `index.html` — dark background, full-viewport root

### `src/store.js`
Full Zustand store with `persist` middleware. Persists: `credits`, `upgrades`, `settings`.
Phase enum: `powered_down | boot | menu | gameplay | settings | upgrades | meltdown | report`. Note: the paused state is `isPaused=true` while `phase='gameplay'` — there is no separate `'paused'` phase value.
Heat thresholds: 100 = overheat (saw lock), 120 = meltdown trigger.
All computed getters (`getMaxOre`, `getGrindDps`, `getCoolingRate`) use `get()` — not stored in state.

### `src/audio/AudioEngine.js`
Singleton Web Audio API engine. BiquadFilter lowpass for pause muffling.
All methods listed in `AGENTS.md §9`. Fire-and-forget oscillator pattern.
`init()` called once on first user gesture to satisfy browser autoplay policy.

### Terrain
`simplex-noise` `createNoise2D()` generating 64×64 height grid at scale=5.
Three-layer octave noise for organic alien dunes. Visual mesh + `HeightfieldCollider` in same component.

### Player
- Dynamic `RigidBody` + `lockRotations` + `colliders="cuboid"`
- Keyboard via `window` event listeners (not `KeyboardControls` hook — simpler for mouse-look compat)
- Mouse-look via `mousemove` + `document.exitPointerLock` / `requestPointerLock`
- Pitch clamped ±60°; `camera.position` synced to `body.translation()` + 1.6 eye height
- Dash: `ShiftLeft/Right` → `DASH_SPEED=20`, `targetFov=100`; normal: `SPEED=8`, `targetFov=75`
- Camera shake: random offset scaled by `heat/100 * 0.03` per frame

### Ore + Economy loop
- 8 static ore veins at fixed world positions (`ORE_POSITIONS`)
- Proximity grind: distance to camera < 5 units → `addOre(getGrindDps() * delta)` + `addHeat(15 * delta)`
- Ejected cube spawns at camera position when `rawOre >= getMaxOre()`
- Silo `onIntersectionEnter` → `addCredits(50)` + `playSell()`

### Visual effects
- `VisualEffects.jsx` — `EffectComposer disableNormalPass` with all three passes
- `chromRef` updated imperatively in `useFrame` for smooth heat-reactive aberration

### UI overlays
All screens use `@react-three/drei` `<Html fullscreen>`. Phase gating in each component.
- `BootScreen` — blinking cursor, single click initiates `audioManager.init()` + power-up audio
- `MainMenu` — NEW EXCAVATION + OS CONFIG buttons; requests pointer lock on game start
- `PauseMenu` — ESC toggle; RESUME / SETTINGS / ABORT MISSION
- `SettingsMenu` — sliders for volume + sensitivity; checkbox for CRT
- `MeltdownScreen` — red flash (meltdown phase) → TITAN LOST report (report phase)
- `UpgradesTerminal` — three upgrade tracks with credit cost scaling per level

---

## §2 — Next implementation priority

Work through these in order. Each is a discrete, shippable unit.

### Priority 1 — Tractor Beam (most impactful gameplay feature)

**Files to create/modify:**
- `src/components/TractorBeam.jsx` (new)
- `src/components/Player.jsx` (add pointer-down/up handlers)
- `src/components/OreSpawner.jsx` (tag cubes with `userData.type='cube'`)

**Implementation steps:**
1. Add an invisible `RigidBody type="kinematicPosition"` ref (`tractorAnchorRef`) inside the scene — the "cursor hook".
2. On `pointerdown`: cast a ray from `camera` position along `camera.getWorldDirection()`. If it hits a `userData.type === 'cube'` RigidBody, capture the ref.
3. Create a `useSpringJoint(tractorAnchorRef, cubeRef, { stiffness: 40, damping: 0.3, restLength: 0 })`.
4. Each frame while pointer is down: `tractorAnchor.setNextKinematicTranslation(camera.pos + lookDir * depth)`. Reduce `depth -= delta * 10` (reel-in).
5. On `pointerup`: read last-frame velocity of cube body → `cubeBody.applyImpulse(throwVelocity)`. Destroy joint by clearing refs.
6. Visual: a thin cyan `<Line>` from camera center to cube (use `@react-three/drei` `<Line>`).

**Reference:** `AGENTS.md §8 Physics rules`, `AGENTS.md §13`

---

### Priority 2 — Headlamp SpotLight + Boot flicker

**File:** `src/components/Player.jsx` or new `src/components/Headlamp.jsx`

```jsx
// Inside Cockpit or Player camera group:
<spotLight
  ref={headlampRef}
  position={[0, 0, 0]}
  target-position={[0, 0, -1]}
  intensity={2}
  angle={0.4}
  penumbra={0.3}
  color="#ffeecc"
  castShadow
/>
```

Boot flicker: in the `boot` phase, run a `useInterval` or `useFrame` for 0.5s that sets `headlampRef.current.intensity = Math.random() * 3` before stabilizing at 2.

---

### Priority 3 — Spark emitter on grind contact

**File:** `src/components/Sparks.jsx` (new)

- On each grind tick (while distance < 5 and not overheated), call a `spawnSpark()` function.
- Each spark: small `<Box args={[0.05,0.05,0.05]}>` with `meshStandardMaterial emissive="#ffaa00" emissiveIntensity={2}` + dynamic Rapier `RigidBody` with upward + random XZ impulse applied immediately after spawn.
- Each spark has TTL ~1.5s (remove from state after that).
- Limit: max 30 live sparks at once (drop oldest if exceeded).

---

### Priority 4 — Ore destruction + debris

**File:** `src/components/OreSpawner.jsx` (modify)

- Add `health` state to each ore vein (start: 100).
- Each grind tick reduces ore health by `getGrindDps() * delta`.
- At health ≤ 0: remove ore vein, spawn 5–8 debris chunks via `InstancedRigidBodies` if count > 20, else individual `RigidBody` balls with radial impulse.
- Debris chunks are `userData.type = 'debris'` (can be tractor-beamed).
- Respawn new ore vein at same position after 15s (configurable).

---

### Priority 5 — Ore shrink (compatible 3D motion library TBD)

**File:** `src/components/OreSpawner.jsx`

Replace static ore mesh with a compatible 3D motion primitive once the project adopts a React Three Fiber-compatible animation library:
```jsx
// Example shape only — use the chosen compatible 3D motion wrapper once selected.
<AnimatedOreMesh scale={healthPct} />
```
Where `healthPct` goes from `1.0` to `0.0` as ore health drains.

---

### Priority 6 — Hit-stop effect

**File:** `src/components/OreSpawner.jsx` or `src/components/Player.jsx`

On the first frame that grinding begins (transition from not-grinding to grinding):
```js
// In useFrame, detect leading edge of grind state
if (justStartedGrinding) {
  const savedDelta = delta
  // Freeze movement/physics for 50ms by setting a ref flag
  hitStopRef.current = true
  setTimeout(() => { hitStopRef.current = false }, 50)
}
// Guard in useFrame:
if (hitStopRef.current) return
```
This creates the "saw teeth biting into rock" kinesthetic impact.

---

### Priority 7 — Spatial audio (Silo hum + dash)

**Files:** `src/audio/AudioEngine.js`, `src/components/Silo.jsx`, `src/components/Player.jsx`

All spatial audio must route through the `audioManager` singleton — do not construct `THREE.AudioListener` or `THREE.PositionalAudio` directly in component code. Add methods to `AudioEngine.js`:

```js
// In AudioEngine.js — add two new methods:
initSiloHum(siloMesh, camera) {
  const listener = new THREE.AudioListener()
  camera.add(listener)
  const sound = new THREE.PositionalAudio(listener)
  // low freq ~60Hz sine connected to positional audio
  siloMesh.add(sound)
  this._siloSound = sound
}

setThrusterVolume(normalizedSpeed) {
  // normalizedSpeed: 0.0 → 1.0 mapped from linvel magnitude
  if (this._thrusterGain) this._thrusterGain.gain.setTargetAtTime(normalizedSpeed, this.ctx.currentTime, 0.05)
}
```

Then call `audioManager.initSiloHum(siloMeshRef.current, camera)` from `Silo.jsx` once after `audioManager.init()`.

Dash thruster volume (in `Player.jsx` `useFrame`):
```js
const vel = bodyRef.current.linvel()
const speed = Math.sqrt(vel.x**2 + vel.y**2 + vel.z**2)
audioManager.setThrusterVolume(speed / DASH_SPEED)
```

---

### Priority 8 — Pause grayscale/wireframe pass

**File:** `src/components/VisualEffects.jsx`

Add a `HueSaturation` effect from `@react-three/postprocessing` and set `saturation=-1.0` when `isPaused`.
The "glowing cyan wireframe" is harder — deferred to later (requires a custom render pass or outline effect).

---

### Priority 9 — Meltdown glitch shader

**File:** `src/components/VisualEffects.jsx`

> No new dependencies required — `GlitchEffect` is part of the already-approved `postprocessing` package.

Use `GlitchEffect` from `postprocessing` package:
```jsx
import { Glitch } from '@react-three/postprocessing'
import { GlitchMode } from 'postprocessing'

{isMelting && (
  <Glitch delay={[0.0, 0.1]} duration={[0.1, 0.3]} strength={[0.3, 1.0]} mode={GlitchMode.CONSTANT_WILD} />
)}
```

---

### Priority 10 — CRT shader (scanlines + barrel)

**File:** `src/components/VisualEffects.jsx`

> No new dependencies required — `@react-three/postprocessing` and `postprocessing` are already approved.

Conditionally render when `settings.crtOverlays === true`. Requires a custom `ShaderPass` with:
- Scanline darkening: `color *= 1.0 - 0.15 * mod(vUv.y * screenHeight, 2.0)`
- Barrel distortion: radial uv warping

Can also use `@react-three/postprocessing`'s `PixelationEffect` as a simpler substitute.

---

### Priority 11 — Diegetic menu raycast (dashboard as interactive surface)

**File:** `src/components/Dashboard.jsx`

The AGENTS.md §18 vision: player shoots the 3D dashboard with the crosshair to select menu items.

Implementation:
1. In Dashboard canvas, render clickable regions for `[ NEW EXCAVATION ]` and `[ OS CONFIG ]` during `menu` phase.
2. Add a `onPointerDown` handler to the dashboard mesh.
3. Read UV coordinates from the intersection event (`event.uv`).
4. Map UV → menu option (NEW EXCAVATION: uv.y < 0.5; OS CONFIG: uv.y >= 0.5).
5. Call appropriate action.

---

### Priority 12 — framer-motion UI panel transitions

**File:** All `*Menu.jsx` overlays

Wrap HTML overlay content in `<motion.div>` from `framer-motion`:
```jsx
<motion.div
  initial={{ opacity: 0, y: -20 }}
  animate={{ opacity: 1, y: 0 }}
  exit={{ opacity: 0, y: 20 }}
  transition={{ duration: 0.3, ease: 'easeOut' }}
>
```
Requires wrapping the phase-conditional render in `<AnimatePresence>` in `App.jsx` / `Scene`.

---

### Priority 13 — maath/random for spores

**File:** `src/components/AmbientSpores.jsx`

Replace current custom `inSphere()` with official maath:
```js
import * as random from 'maath/random/dist/maath-random.esm'
const [sphere] = useState(() => random.inSphere(new Float32Array(5000), { radius: 150 }))
```
(Currently using a custom equivalent because of ESM import complexity — fix once maath import is confirmed working in the build.)

---

## §3 — Known issues

| # | Issue | Severity | File | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Ore grind uses camera proximity (not physics contact) | Medium | `OreSpawner.jsx` | Should use Rapier intersection instead for physical accuracy |
| 2 | No ore health / destruction | High | `OreSpawner.jsx` | Veins never die; hopper fills infinitely |
| 3 | Cube sell cleanup relies on userData callback + body relocation | Medium | `Silo.jsx`, `OreSpawner.jsx` | Works now, but should eventually move to a more explicit world-entity lifecycle |
| 4 | Tractor Beam missing entirely | High | — | Core gameplay mechanic not yet implemented |
| 5 | `maath` inSphere uses custom impl | Low | `AmbientSpores.jsx` | Functional but not using official maath API |
| 6 | No headlamp / spotlight | Medium | `Player.jsx` | Cockpit is dark; only ambient + directional light |
| 7 | Meltdown camera eject is basic (just y+) | Low | `Player.jsx` | Should be a lerp to sky with smooth curve |
| 8 | No visual for tractor beam lock | Medium | — | No line/beam rendered when cube is grabbed |

## §4 — Architecture decisions & rationale (context for future agents)

### Why Rapier and not Cannon.js
The V1–V3 prototype used Cannon.js. When generating convex hulls for the Silo and ore debris, Cannon.js threw thousands of `faceNormal calculation errors` (`Vec3(0,0,-1) looks like it points into the shape`), causing NaN vector propagation and a black WebGL screen crash. Rapier (Rust WASM) was chosen as a replacement and is stable.

### Why no tune.js
`tune.js` is referenced in the original design document but is not available on npm. We replicate its microtonal intent using raw Web Audio API oscillators. The `AudioEngine.js` singleton deliberately mirrors the tune.js API surface from the spec (see `AGENTS.md §9`).

### Why diegetic UI (not DOM overlays)
The design decision to render the HUD inside the 3D scene as a `CanvasTexture` on the dashboard mesh was made to maintain immersion. This is non-negotiable. The only HTML overlays allowed are boot, menus, and settings (which pause the game world).

### Why direct window listeners are the authoritative movement input path
`Player.jsx` uses direct `window.addEventListener` key handlers for movement so mouse-look and pointer-lock behavior stay coupled to the same imperative input loop. `KeyboardControls` was removed from `App.jsx` to avoid having two competing input models in the scaffold.

### Why `useFrame` for cooling (not a timeout/interval)
Cooling needs to be delta-time accurate and pause-aware. A `setInterval` would continue cooling even when paused. `useFrame` with the `isPaused` guard ensures cooling only happens during active gameplay.
