## §1 — What is built (detail)

### Scaffold
- `package.json` — all dependencies locked (see `docs/STANDARDS.md §11`)
- `vite.config.js` — `@vitejs/plugin-react`, optimizeDeps for Three.js ecosystem
- `index.html` — dark background, full-viewport root

### `src/store.js`
Full Zustand store with `persist` middleware. Persists: `credits`, `upgrades`, `settings`.
Phase enum: `powered_down | boot | menu | gameplay | settings | upgrades | meltdown | report`. Note: the paused state is `isPaused=true` while `phase='gameplay'` — there is no separate `'paused'` phase value.
Heat thresholds: 100 = overheat (saw lock), 120 = meltdown trigger.
All computed getters (`getMaxOre`, `getGrindDps`, `getCoolingRate`) use `get()` — not stored in state.

### `src/audio/AudioEngine.js`
Singleton Web Audio API engine. BiquadFilter lowpass for pause muffling.
All methods listed in `AGENTS.md §9`. Fire-and-forget oscillator pattern.
`init()` called once on first user gesture to satisfy browser autoplay policy.

### Terrain
`simplex-noise` `createNoise2D()` generating 64×64 height grid at scale=5.
Three-layer octave noise for organic alien dunes. Visual mesh + `HeightfieldCollider` in same component.

### Player
- Dynamic `RigidBody` + `lockRotations` + `colliders="cuboid"`
- Keyboard via `window` event listeners (not `KeyboardControls` hook — simpler for mouse-look compat)
- Mouse-look via `mousemove` + `document.exitPointerLock` / `requestPointerLock`
- Pitch clamped ±60°; `camera.position` synced to `body.translation()` + 1.6 eye height
- Dash: `ShiftLeft/Right` → `DASH_SPEED=20`, `targetFov=100`; normal: `SPEED=8`, `targetFov=75`
- Camera shake: random offset scaled by `heat/100 * 0.03` per frame

### Ore + Economy loop
- 8 static ore veins at fixed world positions (`ORE_POSITIONS`)
- Proximity grind: distance to camera < 5 units → `addOre(getGrindDps() * delta)` + `addHeat(15 * delta)`
- Ejected cube spawns at camera position when `rawOre >= getMaxOre()`
- Silo `onIntersectionEnter` → `addCredits(50)` + `playSell()`

### Visual effects
- `VisualEffects.jsx` — `EffectComposer disableNormalPass` with all three passes
- `chromRef` updated imperatively in `useFrame` for smooth heat-reactive aberration

### UI overlays
All screens use `@react-three/drei` `<Html fullscreen>`. Phase gating in each component.
- `BootScreen` — blinking cursor, single click initiates `audioManager.init()` + power-up audio
- `MainMenu` — NEW EXCAVATION + OS CONFIG buttons; requests pointer lock on game start
- `PauseMenu` — ESC toggle; RESUME / SETTINGS / ABORT MISSION
- `SettingsMenu` — sliders for volume + sensitivity; checkbox for CRT
- `MeltdownScreen` — red flash (meltdown phase) → TITAN LOST report (report phase)
- `UpgradesTerminal` — three upgrade tracks with credit cost scaling per level

## §2 — Next implementation priority

All M1, M2, and M3 (Mobile / Capacitor) priorities are fully completed and shipped. 

The project has entered M4 (Visual / Audio Polish) and M5 (Content / Progression).

Next logical steps for **M4**:
1. Final cockpit dashboard art pass
2. Ore shrink animation via react-spring
3. AudioEngine mixing pass

Next logical steps for **M5**:
1. Contracts / timed objectives
2. Additional ore variety
3. Environmental variation

## §3 — Known issues

| # | Issue | Severity | File | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Ore grind uses camera proximity (not physics contact) | Medium | `OreSpawner.jsx` | Should use Rapier intersection instead for physical accuracy |
| 2 | No ore health / destruction | High | `OreSpawner.jsx` | Veins never die; hopper fills infinitely |
| 3 | Cube sell cleanup relies on userData callback + body relocation | Medium | `Silo.jsx`, `OreSpawner.jsx` | Works now, but should eventually move to a more explicit world-entity lifecycle |
| 4 | ~~Tractor Beam missing entirely~~ | ~~High~~ | — | **Resolved in Stream A** |
| 5 | ~~`maath` inSphere uses custom impl~~ | ~~Low~~ | `AmbientSpores.jsx` | **Resolved in Stream A** |
| 6 | ~~No headlamp / spotlight~~ | ~~Medium~~ | `Player.jsx` | **Resolved in Stream A** |
| 7 | Meltdown camera eject is basic (just y+) | Low | `Player.jsx` | Should be a lerp to sky with smooth curve |
| 8 | ~~No visual for tractor beam lock~~ | ~~Medium~~ | — | **Resolved in Stream A** — cyan Line drawn |
| 9 | Meltdown radial impulse on nearby rigid bodies | Medium | — | Deferred — no stable world-query API in R3F Rapier |

## §4 — Architecture decisions & rationale (context for future agents)

### Why Rapier and not Cannon.js
The V1–V3 prototype used Cannon.js. When generating convex hulls for the Silo and ore debris, Cannon.js threw thousands of `faceNormal calculation errors` (`Vec3(0,0,-1) looks like it points into the shape`), causing NaN vector propagation and a black WebGL screen crash. Rapier (Rust WASM) was chosen as a replacement and is stable.

### Why no tune.js
`tune.js` is referenced in the original design document but is not available on npm. We replicate its microtonal intent using raw Web Audio API oscillators. The `AudioEngine.js` singleton deliberately mirrors the tune.js API surface from the spec (see `AGENTS.md §9`).

### Why diegetic UI (not DOM overlays)
The design decision to render the HUD inside the 3D scene as a `CanvasTexture` on the dashboard mesh was made to maintain immersion. This is non-negotiable. The only HTML overlays allowed are boot, menus, and settings (which pause the game world).

### Why direct window listeners are the authoritative movement input path
`Player.jsx` uses direct `window.addEventListener` key handlers for movement so mouse-look and pointer-lock behavior stay coupled to the same imperative input loop. `KeyboardControls` was removed from `App.jsx` to avoid having two competing input models in the scaffold.

### Why `useFrame` for cooling (not a timeout/interval)
Cooling needs to be delta-time accurate and pause-aware. A `setInterval` would continue cooling even when paused. `useFrame` with the `isPaused` guard ensures cooling only happens during active gameplay.
